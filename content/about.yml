  Hi, I'm **Ivan Joshua Gamino**, an aspiring fullstack developer with a passion for creating dynamic and efficient web applications.
  For the past few years, I've been dedicated to honing my skills in both front-end and back-end development, striving to build seamless user experiences through clean and maintainable code.
  I work with various technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, React.js, Node.js, PHP, MySQL and NoSQL. Through continuous practice and hands-on projects, I'm developing a strong foundation to become a well-rounded developer.

  ### My Motivation

  What keeps me excited about software development is the constant learning and the challenge of translating complex ideas into real applications.
  It is satisfying to see a project come to life from just a concept to a fully functional product that users can interact with.

  ### What I Do Outside Coding

  When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games and going to the gym.
  Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to browse my [projects](/projects)!
